## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "/assets/images/IMG_7741.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Flavia Capet, and I am a sophmore studying mechanical engineering at Cornell University. I’m especially interested in biomedical engineering and product design, and I’ve been developing hands-on skills through the CUSail Project Team, where I’ve worked on boat deck design in SolidWorks and machining. I also enjoy outreach, like planning STEM activities through the Society of Women Engineers. Looking ahead, I’m eager to apply my technical background and creativity to real-world projects in the mechanical engineering world, while continuing to learn from collaborative, team-driven environments.
